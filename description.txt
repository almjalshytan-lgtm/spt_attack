SPY ATTACK FRAMEWORK v2.0.0-PRO
Official Technical Description Document
​EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
​SPY ATTACK ULTIMATE is a high-performance, modular cybersecurity orchestration
framework engineered for advanced reconnaissance and vulnerability analysis.
Developed by the SPY ATTACK TEAM, this framework consolidates the power of
multiple industry-leading security engines into a single, unified execution
pipeline, designed to maximize efficiency for defensive security auditors and
red team operators alike.
​CORE PHILOSOPHY
​The "SPY ATTACK" philosophy is rooted in "Orchestration over Isolation."
Instead of running isolated scans, our framework builds a relational map of
the target’s infrastructure, ensuring that data from the reconnaissance phase
dynamically informs the vulnerability assessment phase.
​ARCHITECTURAL LAYERS
​LAYER 1: DIGITAL FOOTPRINT RECONNAISSANCE
​Utilizes vertical and horizontal domain correlation.
​Passive Intelligence: Scrapes over 30+ public sources (Crt.sh, Censys, etc.).
​Active Intelligence: High-speed DNS resolution and wildcard filtering.
​LAYER 2: NETWORK & SERVICE FINGERPRINTING
​Advanced Port Scanning: Beyond standard Nmap capabilities using optimized
Syn-scanning techniques.
​Service Profiling: Deep banner grabbing and protocol-specific fingerprinting
to identify actual services behind non-standard ports.
​LAYER 3: AUTOMATED VULNERABILITY AUDITING
​Template-Based Engine: Integration with massive databases of CVEs and
misconfigurations.
​Intelligent Fuzzing: Context-aware directory and file discovery.
​Secrets Extraction: Automated analysis of JavaScript files for leaked
credentials, API keys, and environment variables.
​KEY DIFFERENTIATORS (Why SPY ATTACK is Stronger)
​MULTI-TOOL SYNERGY: Automatically pipes output from Subfinder to Httpx
and finally to Nuclei without manual intervention.
​EVASION MODULES: Integrated WAF detection, user-agent randomization, and
customizable packet delays to bypass modern security controls.
​SCALABILITY: Capable of scanning a single domain or a massive list of CIDR
ranges with multi-threaded performance.
​TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
​Language: Python 3.x (Core Engine)
​Integrated Sub-Engines: Nmap, Nuclei, Subfinder, Httpx.
​Command Arsenal: 60+ Customizable Arguments.
​Output Support: Console (Standard), JSON (Machine Readable), HTML/PDF (Reports).
​TARGET USE CASES
​Corporate Attack Surface Management.
​Red Team Operations & Penetration Testing.
​Bug Bounty Hunting & Automated Recon.
​Defensive Hardening & Asset Inventory.
​MISSION STATEMENT
​To empower the SPY ATTACK TEAM with superior automation, turning raw data into
actionable security intelligence, and ensuring that no stone is left unturned
in the pursuit of a hardened digital environment.
